Association Rule mining is 2 step process:

We generate Frequent ItemsetsWe generate rules from the frequent itemsets which were generated in no 1 step.

For no 1 step, we use an algorithm, which is also known as "Apriori Algorithm"

To distinguish frequent itemsets from given itemsets, we need a minimum thresold. Those itemsets which are equal to or above thresold are known as frequent itemsets




Association rule mining is 2 step process.

1st step is to generate frequent itemset by applying apriori algoritm
2nd step is to generate rules from the frequent itemsets wihch were generated in 1st step.
3rd step is to compute confidence of each rule generated
4th step is to discard those rules which are below confidence
Rules which are above or equal to confidence are the final rules which are generated



Every data mining tasks is completed with an alogirthm or mathematical function or diagrammatic approach.

Association Rule Mining- We used Apriori Algorithm

Prediction- We use mathematical formula known as regression.

1. Count Frequency of Every Item of Database
2. Rearrange the database in order of frequency in decreasing manner
3. Generate a general FP Tree for overall  database 
4. Create Conditional FP Tree for each and every item of database by using general FP tree as reference
