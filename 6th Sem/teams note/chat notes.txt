Classification


Classification is also known as supervised learning.

Historical Data->Experience->Future data classify


This is also supervised learning because in classification historical data is used to create a model so that future data is classified on the basis of that model.


Historical data is also known as Traning data set


Future data is also known as Test data set


In classification, from training set data, we create a model. For model, we create a decision tree and implement it on test data set.


In order to create a model.i.e decision tree, we need attributes and class labels.


In the pdf example, Class label are yes and no.


attributes are age, income, student, credit_rating


Tree are made of nodes. Starting node is know as root node. Last node is known as leaf node.


Root node and child nodes are always attributes.

Last node or leaf node are class labels

In order to make decision tree for classification, we dont do random approach. We use and algorithm known as ID3 algorithm (Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm)

Create the model. In which we choose to make a decision tree. In order to reduce randomness in attribute selection while making decision tree, we use an algorithm known and ID 3 algorithm
